#Migrate the music store program we created to an OOP approach.  
#You can use classes for modelling products, services, 
#customer tier, the shopping cart...
#
#Products have name and price.
#Services have price.
#Customer tier have a discount.
#Shopping cart has:
#a list of products
#a list of services
#and a method to add new products and another for services
#a checkout method that receives a customer tier and calculates the price
