#    STEP 1: 
#    we get the nodes of our graph
    
    nodes = [nodes for nodes in graph]    
    
#    STEP 2:
#    we get the combinations with a library. These are the necessary 
#    connections two achieve a fully connected graph. We use combinations and
#    not permutations because we consider 'ab' to be equal to 'ba'
    
    combinations_list = list(combinations(nodes,2))
    
    
#    STEP 3: 
#    we convert the combinations tuplets into a list of two-character strings.
#    We use a list comprehension but it's the same as the follwing code:
#    
#    combinations_clean = []
#    
#    for element in combinations_list: 
#         combinations_clean.append(''.join(element))
         
   
    
    
    combinations_clean = [''.join(element) for element in combinations_list]
 
#    STEP 4
#    We get the edges of our graph in the same format as our combinations. 
#   We use a list comprehension but it's the same as the follwing code:
    
#     edges = []   
#     for node in graph: 
#        for other_node in graph[node]: 
#            edges.append(node + other_node)
     
    edges = [node + other_node for node in graph for other_node in graph[node]]    


 
#    STEP 5: The magic
    counter = 0
    for edge in edges: 
        if edge in combinations_clean or edge[::-1] in combinations_clean:
            counter += 1
            if counter == len(combinations_clean):
