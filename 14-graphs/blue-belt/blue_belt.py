#    we get the nodes of our graph

#    STEP 2:
#    we get the combinations with a library. These are the necessary 
#    connections two achieve a fully connected graph. We use combinations and
#    not permutations because we consider 'ab' to be equal to 'ba'

#    STEP 3: 
#    we convert the combinations tuplets into a list of two-character strings.

#    
#    combinations_clean = []
#    
#    for element in combinations_list: 
#         combinations_clean.append(''.join(element))

#    We get the edges of our graph in the same format as our combinations. 
#   We use a list comprehension but it's the same as the follwing code:
    
#     edges = []   
#     for node in graph: 
#        for other_node in graph[node]: 
#            edges.append(node + other_node)
